# Project: Burnout Risk & Mental Wellness Assessor

## Description

This project is a client-side, confidential self-assessment instrument intended to offer a sophisticated assessment of a user's likelihood of burnout. The program is an interactive quiz using the three essential dimensions of the **Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)**, a prominent psychological measure of burnout.

The test is divided into three categories:
1.  **Emotional Exhaustion:** Having feelings of being stretched too thin and depleted by work or academic endeavors.
2.  **Cynicism (or Depersonalization):** Experiencing detachment, cynicism, or negative cynicism in one's work.
3.  **Professional Efficacy:** Feeling effective, successful, and accomplished at work.

In the realm of Indian wellness and psychology, this instrument is solving the increasing mental health issues in high-stress education and career settings. Providing a breakdown in detail, it provides greater awareness of oneself than an ordinary score.

**Of critical importance, all computation occurs locally within the user's browser. No personal information is ever gathered or transmitted to any server, providing 100% privacy.**
